Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at `Prodigy Infotech`. In this task, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset provided, focusing on creating a visualization to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this task is 
<a href="https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%201world_population_dataset">
World Bank Population Data ( By World Bank Group )
</a>.
This dataset contains records of population for the year 2024.
 

## Tools and Libraries used

- Kaggle notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlip & Seaborn for visualization



## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and outliers in the dataset and handled them accordingly.

2. **Visualization**: Created a bar chart, stacked chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. 



## Conclusion

Task 1 successfully executed the initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by focusing on the distribution of the world's largest country populations in 2024. The analysis required cleaning the World Bank data by merging it with country metadata and removing aggregate entries, resulting in a Horizontal Bar Chart of the top 10 nations. This visualization is essential as it immediately confirms the highly uneven geographical distribution of the global population, which will inform any future steps involving demographic projections, resource distribution, or regional comparative analysis.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
